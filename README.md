### Tokenized Film Production Insurance System

I'll create a tokenized film production insurance system using Clarity smart contracts with the requested components.

## Smart Contracts

Let's start with the four main contracts:

```typescriptreact project="film-insurance"
...
```

## Tests

Now let's create tests for our contracts using Vitest:

```javascript project="Film Insurance Tests" file="tests/project-verification.test.js"
...
```

```javascript project="Film Insurance Tests" file="tests/risk-assessment.test.js"
...
```

```javascript project="Film Insurance Tests" file="tests/coverage-management.test.js"
...
```

```javascript project="Film Insurance Tests" file="tests/claim-processing.test.js"
...
```

## PR Details and README

```markdown project="Film Insurance" file="PR-DETAILS.md"

# Tokenized Film Production Insurance System

## Overview

This project implements a tokenized film production insurance system using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. The system provides a decentralized approach to film production insurance, enabling transparent verification, risk assessment, coverage management, and claim processing.

## Architecture

The system consists of four main smart contracts:

1. **Project Verification Contract**: Validates legitimate film productions
2. **Risk Assessment Contract**: Evaluates potential risks that could affect filming
3. **Coverage Management Contract**: Tracks specific insured aspects of production
4. **Claim Processing Contract**: Handles documentation and payment for covered events


## Contract Details

### Project Verification Contract

This contract handles the registration and verification of film projects:

- Project owners can register their projects with details like title, budget, and filming dates
- Authorized verifiers can approve or reject projects
- Projects must be verified before they can be insured
- Maintains a registry of verified projects and their details


### Risk Assessment Contract

This contract evaluates the risk profile of verified film projects:

- Authorized assessors evaluate risks across multiple categories (location, weather, cast, equipment)
- Calculates an overall risk score and categorizes projects as low, medium, or high risk
- Risk assessments are required before coverage can be purchased
- Assessment data is stored on-chain for transparency


### Coverage Management Contract

This contract manages insurance policies for verified projects:

- Supports different coverage types (cast, equipment, location, weather, comprehensive)
- Calculates premiums based on risk category and coverage type
- Manages policy lifecycle (creation, activation, cancellation)
- Enforces business rules like policy period validation


### Claim Processing Contract

This contract handles the claim submission and processing workflow:

- Policyholders can submit claims with evidence
- Authorized reviewers evaluate claims
- Multi-step process: submission → review → approval → payment
- Validates claims against policy terms (coverage limits, policy period)


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) - Clarity development environment
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - For running tests


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/your-username/film-insurance.git
cd film-insurance
```


2. Install dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install
```


3. Run tests:

```plaintext
npm test
```




## Usage

### Deploying Contracts

Deploy the contracts to the Stacks blockchain using Clarinet:

```plaintext
clarinet deploy
```

### Interacting with Contracts

#### Register a Film Project

```plaintext
(contract-call? .project-verification register-project u1 "Film Title" "Description" u1000000 u100 u200)
```

#### Verify a Project

```plaintext
(contract-call? .project-verification verify-project u1 true)
```

#### Create Risk Assessment

```plaintext
(contract-call? .risk-assessment create-risk-assessment u1 u2 u1 u2 u2 "Risk notes")
```

#### Purchase Coverage

```plaintext
(contract-call? .coverage-management create-coverage u1 u2 u500000 u150 u250)
```

#### Submit a Claim

```plaintext
(contract-call? .claim-processing submit-claim u1 u200000 u175 "Equipment damage" 0x1234567890abcdef)
```
